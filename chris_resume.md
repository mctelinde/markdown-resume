Technical Experience

Databases
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Programming Languages
:   **C#/.NET** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to mention some others together at the end. A format that works well here is a description list where the first few items have their first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **JavaScript/Angular** Description of your experience with lang, perhaps again including a [link][ref], this time placing the url reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source file).

:   **Python:** Description of your experience with second-lang, perhaps again including a [link][ref], this time placing the url reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source file). 

:   Basic knowledge of **C++**
